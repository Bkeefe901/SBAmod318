# SBA 318: Express Server Application

## Description
For my project I am doing a server that stores 3 different data categories (users, bikes, and components). The users data has info on each user (anyone who has uploaded bike and component info). The bikes data contains info on different bicycle models, and what users own that bike. The components data contains info on various components for bikes and which users use those components.
